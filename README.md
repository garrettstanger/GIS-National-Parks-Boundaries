# Overview

This is a simple ARCGIS mapping project that I have been working on so I can better understand how to use Javascript to create and manipulate maps. Throughout this project
I relied a lot on tutorials provided by the ArcGIS website to create a good framework of what my project would be. After I completed several of the tutorials, I 
went on to start mapping out boundries of some of the national parks located on the west coast. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used the ArcGIS website which provided me with the tutorials and the means to get an API to generate a map in my project. I used VS code as my editor and almost all
Javascript as my programming language with a hint of HTML.

# Future Work

* Getting the coordinates for the parks is pretty painful and slow, I wanted to find a way to pull the coordinates for the polygons from somewhere but I wasn't able to find an easy way.
* I want to get pictures to work inside of the popups.
* Getting different popups to help make the map more lively.
